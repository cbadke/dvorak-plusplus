A custom keyboard inspired by Roland Kaufmann's Programmer Dvorak layout.

This rearranges the symbol keys to a percieved convenient location. Absolutely no science was used in the decisions.

I liked the idea of putting the numbers in the shift positions of the keys for programming but I kept the numbers on
the more common 1-0 layout for less confusion on my part.
